== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use the Filter Widget? =

If you're having trouble getting the Filter Widget to work properly, follow these steps to ensure it's set up correctly:
1. Ensure that you have set a unique ID or class for the target post widget. Without it, the widget will not know where to apply the filters.
2. Verify that you have selected the correct post type to filter.

= The post meta are not displaying =

The list of available meta fields will only display for the selected post type.

For more details, check out this [article](https://wpsmartwidgets.com/doc/better-post-and-filter-widgets/filter-widget/#filter-configuration).

= Why isn’t AJAX working on my site? =

AJAX should work automatically on most WordPress themes built according to standards. However, if AJAX isn't working, here are a few things to check:

1. **Check if WordPress logging is enabled.** Sometimes, when WordPress logging is enabled, it can interfere with AJAX functionality. Try disabling logging to see if that resolves the issue.
2. **Ensure your theme supports AJAX.** Some themes, especially older or custom-built ones, might not properly support AJAX. Make sure your theme is up to date and follows WordPress best practices.
3. **Check for JavaScript errors.** JavaScript errors on the page can prevent AJAX from working. Open your browser’s developer tools and check the console for any errors that could be affecting AJAX functionality.
4. **Conflicting plugins.** Certain plugins, especially caching or performance optimization plugins, might conflict with AJAX. Try temporarily disabling them to see if the issue persists.
5. **Check server-side restrictions.** Some servers might have restrictions that prevent AJAX requests from functioning properly. Contact your hosting provider to ensure that AJAX requests are not being blocked by security rules or firewall settings.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, feel free to reach out on the [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/better-post-filter-widgets-for-elementor/) for further assistance.

= Does the Filter Widget work with custom post types (CPT)? =

Yes, it does out-of-the-box, but be aware of the following:
1. The post type you choose in the filter will override the post type selected in the post widget. For example, if your post widget is showing posts, but you select products in the filter, once you interact with the filter, the post widget will display products instead of posts.
2. If you want the filter to return results based on the selected meta or taxonomy instead of the post type, you can choose the "Any" option under the post type to filter.
3. Dynamic filtering can be enabled to include the current archive context in the filter results.

= Is the Filter Widget compatible with other widgets? =

The filter widget is designed to work with most widgets that use a post query, such as post or product widgets. If a widget pulls data via a post query, the filter can potentially hook into it. However, pagination is fully supported only for widgets from Better Post & Filter Widgets for Elementor and Elementor Pro. Other widgets may lack pagination or loading animations, as these features rely on specific HTML and CSS.
